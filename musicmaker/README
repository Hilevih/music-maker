	= USING THE PLUGIN =
	====================

WARNING: Using this plugin will create a board in the world as soon as player interacts with environment,
regardless if a command is used or not.

REQUIREMENTS:
	There must be a folder called "songs" in your plugins-folder
	This can also be changed by changing "filepath" in ListToXML and XMLToList to new path

EXPLANATION OF THE PLUGIN:
	The meaning behind this plugin is to make a way to create music in minecraft, using minecraft sounds.
	At this point all possible noteblock sounds have been added, as well as some environment sounds.
	In order to make a song, use the tools explained in the next parts. On the board, each column represents sounds
	that will be played simultaneously. Columns will have a delay on when they're played.
	Amount of rows does not matter, although it's not recommended to have many extra ones to save space.

GETTING STARTED:
	Use the command /create, this will teleport you to the place board will be at, as well as give you tools needed for it.
	WARNING: All items in your hotbar will be removed when using this command.
	It's recommended to restart after you're done with the song, as it doesn't remove everything on restart. In case board is
	not removed when done with it, add enough rows and columns to cover all and then restart.
	

BOARD LAYOUT:
	Redstone block:
		default in the topleft corner, used sometimes when adding (more later)
	Diamond block:
		Marks a column on the board
	Emerald block:
		Marks a row on the board
	Concrete:
		Separator of basically everything
	Bedrock:
		Empty note spot
	Anything else:
		Non-empty note spot, type varies based on the note's sound type
		

TOOL INSTRUCTIONS:
	Shears - Adder / Copier:
		Left Click - Copy settings of the note you're looking at. This will then be used if you add a new block.
		Right Click - Depending on where you're looking at:
			Redstone Block - Add column to the right of it and row under
			Diamond Block - Add column to the right
			Emerald Block - Add row under
			Bedrock - Add note with selected values
		Shift + Left Click - When looking at the diamond blocks on top, copies the whole column
			- Can copy multiple columns, but they must be clicked in order
			- Selected columns can be removed via "Other settings" aka redstone comparator
		Shift + Right Click - When looking at the diamond blocks on top, adds selected columns to the right of it
		
	Ladder - Pitch changer (Note on board):
		Depending on the block you're looking at:
			Any note - Change pitch of the note
			Diamond - Change pitch of each note in the column
			Emerald - Change pitch of each note in the row
		Left click to decrease by one, right to increase by one
		
	TNT - Volume changer (Note on board):
		Depending on the block you're looking at:
			Any note - Change volume of the note
			Diamond - Change volume of each note in the column
			Emerald - Change volume of each note in the row
		Left click to decrease by 0.1, right to increase by 0.1
		
	Noteblock - Sound type chooser:
		Clicking opens a GUI that allows you to choose what sound you want the note to be.
		This includes eg. all different noteblock sounds (that are added)
		
	Blaze powder - Pitch changer (Selected, the one to be added):
		Right click to increase by one, left click to decrease by one.

	Redstone comparator - Other settings:
		Opens GUI with multiple different options:
			Noteblock - Disabled pitches:

				This will make pitch changers ignore disabled pitches, however they can still be selected from the GUI.
			Sugar - Speed changer:
				Right click to decrease, left click to increase. Lower the value, faster the song
			Dragon egg - Save song:

	==================
	= ABOUT THE CODE =
	==================
	
Classes:

	Board					Most important class in the plugin. Stores information of the song making board and has most methods for all
							changes on it. For the most part code is divided so that each tool has its own section, additionally misc sections
							for some helper methods

			
	CommandCreateSong		/create command, gives players the tools and teleports them to starting location

	
	InputGetter				Gets player input from chat when either saving or loading a song. For this player, whose input we want,
							is added on a waiting list

	
	ListToXML				Called when saving a song. Gets all the notes and makes an XML file with them. Requires a folder "songs"
							in plugins-folder

				
	Main					Main class of the plugin. Sets up listeners and commands

	
	MiscGui					GUI for "Other settings and tools" aka the redstone comparator tool in hotbar. Communicates back to Board
							depending on which item is clicked.

				
	Note					Represents a single note on the board. Each note has a Soundtype (For example noteblock harp sound),
							pitch (number of uses, 0-24, as well as actual pitch calculated from this) and volume (float 0-1).

				
	OnJoinMessage			Looks at PlayerJoinEvent and messages the player instructions when they join the server.

	
	PitchChooserGui			GUI for choosing a pitch, called by clicking blaze powder while sneaking. Clicking on an item
							will change the chosen pitch. Color of the items depends on whether the pitch is currently
							selected, disabled or not disabled

						
	PitchDisablerGui		GUI for disabling pitches. Disabling them will make them be skipped when "scrolling" with
							pitch changers, and make the GUI items red. Clicking on an item will toggle the status

							
	PlaySong				Plays the song currently on board from the starting point given. Has a single repeating runnable
							that can be cancelled if needed. Speed will depend on the speed of the song, notes on the notes

					
	SoundTypeChooserGui		GUI for choosing the type of the sound. Currently has a set size, so if adding more sounds
							the size might have to be changed

							
	TargetBlockChecker		Listener for interact events. Calls appropriate method in Board based on the tool

	
	XMLToList				Called when loading a song. Opens an XML file (if exists), and creates a song based on them. Should
							keep the song the way it was, rows and columns should also remain unless there's an empty row at the end.
							Requires a file called "songs" in plugins-folder.
							
							
							
Notes if expanding:
	If adding more possible sound types, the block can't be Redstone, Diamond, Emerald or Any concrete, unless code is changed.
	The GUI size will also need to be changed possibly.
	
	Most GUIs are based on GUI name and material types of GUI items.
	If name is changed, both listeners need a change in the name check.
	If an item of the same type is added to the same GUI (except for SoundTypeChooserGui, that one should work always), the
	item names have to be checked instead (clickedItem.getItemMeta().getDisplayName() for example).
